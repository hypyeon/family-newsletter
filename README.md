## Description
The Family Newsletter Generator is a web application that helps families create and customize beautifully formatted newsletters to share updates with loved ones. Users can fill out a guided questionnaire to add family details, select sections, and input text for each section with character count guidance. Each section allows photo uploads or placeholders, and users can save drafts or download the final newsletter as a PDF. With Firebase authentication and storage, users can securely log in, save drafts, and revisit them at any time.
